# Recommendation-System
Project Overview:

This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system that utilizes a content-based approach to suggest personalized movie suggestions to users. The system will utilize the TMDB 5000 Movie Database from Kaggle to extract relevant movie information and employ machine learning techniques to generate recommendations based on content similarity.

Project Flow:

Data Acquisition and Preparation:
a. Data Sources:
- TMDB 5000 Movie Database
- Movies dataset
- Credits dataset

b. Data Preprocessing:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understand the distribution of data variables
- Identify and remove irrelevant or redundant columns
- Handle missing values appropriately

- Feature Engineering:
    - Create a new 'tag' column by combining information from 'overview', 'genres', 'keywords', 'cast', and 'crew' columns
    - Transform data to improve text quality (remove spaces between names, convert text to lowercase, remove stop words)
    - Convert text data to numerical vectors using a bag-of-words approach
    - Remove common stop words that don't add semantic meaning
    - Apply stemming to reduce words to their root form
    - Calculate cosine similarity between movie vectors to determine content similarity
Model Building:

a. Model Selection:
- Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm suitable for content-based recommendation
- Examples include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Nearest Neighbors (NN), or cosine similarity-based approaches (In this model, we used cosine similarity-based approaches)

b. Model Training:
- Train the selected model using the preprocessed and vectorized movie data
- Optimize model parameters to achieve optimal recommendation performance

Website Development:

a. Front-end Design:
- Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the recommendation system
- Provide search functionality to enable users to find specific movies
- Display recommended movies based on content similarity and user preferences

b. Back-end Implementation:
- Implement the trained model and data processing steps into the web application
- Enable real-time recommendations based on user input and interactions
- Ensure efficient data retrieval and processing to maintain user experience

Deployment:

a. Deployment Platform:
- Choose a suitable deployment platform, such as GitHub or Streamlit
- Consider factors like scalability, reliability, and ease of maintenance

b. Deployment Process:
- Package the web application and dependencies for deployment
- Configure the deployment environment and integrate with the chosen platform
- Monitor and maintain the deployed application for optimal performance and security

Methodology:

Content-Based Filtering:

Analyze movie content features, such as genre, director, actors, and keywords
Identify similar movies based on these content features
Recommend movies with similar content to those the user has enjoyed in the past
Cosine Similarity:

Represent movie content as vectors using techniques like bag-of-words
Calculate cosine similarity between movie vectors to quantify content similarity
Recommend movies with high cosine similarity to those the user has liked
Machine Learning Techniques:

Employ machine learning algorithms to learn from user preferences and movie content
Train models to predict movie recommendations based on content similarity
Optimize model performance using techniques like cross-validation and parameter tuning
Expected Outcomes:

Personalized Movie Recommendations:

Provide users with tailored movie suggestions based on their preferences and past viewing history
Enhance user engagement and satisfaction by recommending relevant and enjoyable movies
Movie Discovery:

Help users discover new and interesting movies that align with their tastes
Expand users' movie horizons by exposing them to diverse genres, directors, and actors
Effective Data Utilization:

Extract meaningful insights from movie data to provide personalized recommendations
Leverage machine learning techniques to analyze and utilize movie content effectively
