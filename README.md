# Recommendation-System
This project aims to develop a movie recommendation system that utilizes a content-based approach to suggest personalized movie suggestions to users. The system will utilize the TMDB 5000 Movie Database from Kaggle to extract relevant movie information and employ machine learning techniques to generate recommendations based on content similarity.
